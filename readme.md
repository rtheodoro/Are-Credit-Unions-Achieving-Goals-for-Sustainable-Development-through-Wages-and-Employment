# Are Credit Unions Achieving Goals for Sustainable Development through Wages and Employment?

This project was created to investigate the relationship between credit unions and sustainable development, focusing on the inclusion of women and black people. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze whether credit unions in Brazil are contributing to sustainable development goals through their practices related to wages and employment, particularly in terms of gender and racial inclusion.

## Methodology
The project compares wages and employment data from credit unions in Brazil over a period of time. It examines trends in the representation of women and black individuals in the workforce, as well as their distribution across different job categories and salary levels. The analysis also explores any changes over time and regional differences within Brazil.

## Results
The results of the analysis highlight the slow progress towards inclusivity in credit unions, with women and black individuals still underrepresented in strategic positions and earning lower salaries compared to their counterparts. Despite some improvements over time, disparities persist, indicating the need for further efforts to promote equality and inclusion within credit unions.

## Limitations
One limitation of this project is the inability to explore individual credit unions to analyze specific inclusion strategies being implemented. Additionally, the analysis is limited to available data and may not capture all relevant factors influencing wages and employment in credit unions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while credit unions have the potential to contribute to sustainable development goals through their practices related to wages and employment, there is still work to be done to ensure greater equality and inclusion within the sector. Further research and efforts are needed to address existing disparities and promote a more inclusive and equitable workforce in credit unions.
